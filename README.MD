# Intelligent Quantum Transmutation

## Overview

**Intelligent Quantum Transmutation (IQT)** is an innovative framework that integrates quantum mechanics, artificial intelligence, and complex systems theory. The aim is to enable the transformation of systems or material states at a quantum level using intelligent algorithms capable of analyzing and optimizing the transformation pathways.

## Key Components

- **Quantum Mechanics**: Utilized to understand and control quantum states and their transformations.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: AI is employed to analyze complex systems, predict outcomes, and determine optimal transformation paths.
- **Complex Systems Theory**: Provides insights into how various elements within a system interact and evolve over time.

## Project Structure

- `quantum_module.py`: 
Manages quantum state transformations and simulations.
- `ai_module.py`: 
Implements AI algorithms for decision-making and learning based on quantum state behavior.
- `complex_systems_module.py`: 
Simulates and adapts complex systems in response to quantum transformations.
- `iqt_algorithm.py`: 
Main script that ties together all components to perform an Intelligent Quantum Transmutation.
